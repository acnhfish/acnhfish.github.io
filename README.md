# acnhfish.github.io
This is the repo for [this website](https://acnhfish.github.io/)

The website displays bugs and fish found in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

By default it displays the fish available at the current local time and date. There are filters to change month, time, and what is visible. Default is northern hemisphere, but there's an option for that, too. 

You can also save your collection, which is stored in localStorage, along with hemisphere.
